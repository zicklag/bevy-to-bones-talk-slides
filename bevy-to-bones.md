Major points to cover:

- Why we we felt the need to move away from Bevy to our own solution.
- How we moved piece-by-piece away from Bevy to Bones.
- What the technology ended up, and how it works.

### From Bevy to Bones

<!-- .slide: data-timing="10" -->

**"Accidentally" Making a Game Engine**

Notes:

- Hey everyone!
- Today I'm going to talk about mine and the Jumpy community's journey from Bevy to Bones
- as we "accidentally" made a game engine.

Isn't This a _Bevy_ Meetup?

Notes:

- The first thing you might be asking is, "isn't this a _Bevy_ meetup?
- The answer to that of course is yes, but
- as you'll see ‚è≠

Isn't This a _Bevy_ Meetup?

Yes, **we couldn't have made <u>Bones</u> without <u>Bevy</u>**

Bones is like Bevy's **little brother**

<!-- .element: class="fragment" style="margin-top: 1em"  -->

Notes:

- we couldn't have made Bones without Bevy
- Bones was **heavily** influenced by Bevy's design and is in fact
- ‚è≠Ô∏è kind of like Bevy's little brother.

## What is Jumpy?

2D <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-left"  -->

Multiplayer <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-right"  -->

Shooter Game <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-up"  -->

‚ú® With Modding ‚ú® <!-- .element: class="fragment"  -->

Notes:

- That brings us to "What is Jumpy?"
- Jumpy is a
- ‚è≠ Ô∏è2D
- ‚è≠Ô∏è Multiplayer
- ‚è≠Ô∏è Shooter Game
- that's all about fun couch play, emergent gameplay, and importantly ‚è≠Ô∏è
- ‚ú® _modding_ ‚ú®

### Rewriting Jumpy In Bevy

<!-- .slide: data-timing="8" -->

<ul>
    <li>Jumpy was using <a href="https://macroquad.rs/" target="_blank">Macroquad</a></li>
    <li>But we were already using Bevy for <a href="https://github.com/fishfolk/punchy/" target="_blank">Punchy</a></li>
</ul>

Notes:

- When I took over as lead developer for Jumpy, it was currently written with Macroquad.
- But we were already using bevy for Punchy, another game in the Fish Folk universe, and it was going very well.

### Advantages to Bevy

<!-- .slide: data-timing="30" -->

- Large community
- Good cross-platform support
- We already had prior Bevy investments:
  - Nested YAML Asset System
  - <span style="display: flex; align-items: center;">Scriptable ECS: <code style="font-size: 0.7em; margin-left: 0.5em;">bevy_mod_js_scripting</code></span>

Notes:

- That led us to consider rewriting Jumpy in Bevy.
- There were some compelling advantages.
- For one, Bevy head a large and growing community, which had already shown a lot of ability to get things done
- It had good cross-platform and rendering support, and
<!-- - While I'm not the most experienced with Macroquad, when I started work on Jumpy, the developer before me was writing a new renderer to overcome limitations in Macroquad, so switching to Bevy seemed preferable to maintaining our own renderer. -->
- we already had investments in Bevy.
- For Punchy, I had created a nest YAML asset loading system, so we could hot reload all of our config.
- Most importantly, Bevy had up-and-coming scripting support. This was through the `bevy_mod_js_scripting` plugin, which I had just finished contributing to in order to get web support, and we had a working proof-of-concept already in Punchy.

    <div class="fragment" style="position: absolute; bottom: -2em; right: 4em; transform: rotate(-0deg)">Map Editor</div>
</div>

Notes:

- So to enable modding and to use the same engine for more of our games, we started rewriting Jumpy in Bevy.
- This actually went really well. We got
- ‚è≠Ô∏è maps loading,
- ‚è≠Ô∏è physics ported,
- the ‚è≠Ô∏è main menu,
- and even had the start to an in-game ‚è≠Ô∏è map editor, all in pretty good time.
- Then came the next big hurdle, and something I had never done before

</div>

Notes:
- I started off with a client-server model, running a headless Bevy instance on the server and synchronizing transforms.
- This had horrible visual glitching because players were skipping around and jittering constantly.
- It was a good POC, but now I had to figure out how to make things look nice.

</div>

Notes:
- After doing more research I found that the answer is to do "client-side-prediction", which basically means being able to run the game,
but be to jump back to server snapshots, while fast-forwarding the game back to the present to compensate for latency.
